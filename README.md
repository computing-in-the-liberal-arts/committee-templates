# New-Repository-Template

This repository provides a template for making new repositories for comittee work.  It contains the basic setup for a GitHub pages site with using the same Jekel theme that all of the other pages use.

## Usage:

To create a repo for a new event or aspect of committee business (e.g. like the pre-symposium events):
1. Click the green "Use this template" button
2. Select "Create a new repository"
3. Ensure that the new repository is being created in the `computing-in-the-liberal-arts` organization.
4. Give the new repository a name (e.g. `SIGCSE2023-Affiliated-Event`)
   * Note the new GitHub pages site will be published under the URL: `computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/<repo name>` where `<repo name>` is the name that you give the new repository in this step.
5. Create the repository.
6. In the "Settings" of the new repository:
   a. Go to the "Pages" option on the left.
   b. Choose "Deploy from branch" from the "Source"
   c. Choose `main` branch
   d. Choose `/docs` folder
7. Edit the `index.md` file in `/docs` to add the appropriate content for the new site.
8. Add additional files or directories as necessary.
9. Commit the changes to the `main` branch.
